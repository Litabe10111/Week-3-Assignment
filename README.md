These two files demonstrate:

Selectors: Element selectors (body, main, header, footer), class selectors (.card)

Box model: Use of padding, border, margin, box-shadow

Consistent spacing: Standard padding/margin values across sections

Box-sizing: Set globally to border-box for predictable layout

Both files work together to showcase how to:

Proper use of selectors and basic styling properties

Clear implementation of the CSS Box Model

Consistent spacing, sizing, and layout styling
